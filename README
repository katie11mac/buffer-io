Known Bugs: N/A

Questions to Ask: 
- RDONLY: Check if it is only write 
- Intermingled read and writes: Change buffer size to be bigger (1024) and test reading/writing amounts that are smaller than buffer size (read 12 write 13 around 10 times)
- Making the myread more concise: create functions and use differing arguments as paramenter (around 116-128 and 201-213)
